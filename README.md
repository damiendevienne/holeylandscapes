# Scripts and data associated with the answer to Dochtermann et al.'s (2023) publication on holey landscapes

## Data

In `data/G_matrices` are all the Insecta matrices (ID 35 in Dochtermann et al.) recovered from the literature. 

## Scripts

Script in `code.R` allows redoing all the simulations and computations performed for Fig. 1 of the reply to Dochtermann et al. This scripts loads (i) `Wright_vs_Holey(Functions).R` that contains the original functions from Dochtermann et al. (2023) recovered from their github repo, and (ii) `HoleyLandscape_Newfunctions.R` that are functions to perform the Gaussian and the holey simulations, largely taken from the original simulation functions of Dochtermann et al. They were simply slightly re-designed for convenience.
